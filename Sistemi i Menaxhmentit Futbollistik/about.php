                    The European Super League (ESL), officially The Super League, is a proposed seasonal club football competition that would be initially 
                    contested by twenty European football clubs, being twelve of them the competition's founding members. It is organised by the European 
                    Super League Company, S.L., a commercial enterprise created to rival the UEFA Champions League, Europe's premier club football tournament 
                    organised by UEFA. <br>
                    The announcement of the European Super League in April 2021 received wide opposition from fans, players, managers, politicians, and other 
                    clubs in England, the most represented country in the project (6). It also received opposition from UEFA, FIFA, and some national governments.
                    Much of the criticism against the ESL was due to concerns about elitism and the lack of competitiveness within the competition, as it would have 
                    consisted of only high-ranking teams from a few European countries.
